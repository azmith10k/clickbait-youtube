# clickbait-youtube
Clickbait is one of the most prevalent problems of the twenty-first-century internet. It is the simple act of enticing the viewers with a catchy and attractive headline or cover, only for the user to be sorely disappointed to find the advertised content not even exist. Worse, the content contains blatant lies and misinformation, which leads to the spread of hoaxes and scams all over the internet, be it via forums, group chats, or even through word of mouth.

Usually, clickbait as a research topic is standard in news articles and text-based content. However, we are trying to apply the same principles to the world of video-based content, and the most prominent video-based content host and provider on the internet is YouTube. In this age of intolerance and impatience, people quickly believe what they see, especially if it is something negative. No one has the common sense or the time to fact-check what they see on a minute-to-minute basis. Moreover, video-based content consumption is much more appealing to the younger generation than text-based resources. Thus, such an impressionable audience must not be fooled by the media they consume.

In this project, we 
- Analyze the extent of clickbait on YouTube
- Which categories are more at fault than others
- Develop a prototypical classification model that can detect if a video is clickbait or not by dissecting the various components and features of a YouTube video
- Use state-of-the-art technologies to parse the various media features
- Develop our production classification model that considers user feedback to tie it all up.
